### 09/09/2021 - Day 4

- Worked on my mac this time, since I went Surrey and my mouse and keyboard is in Surrey now
- Using sockets on multiple ports works perfectly on mac. It works using threads and just creating them normally with different ports
- Will see how the thread code works on windows
- Otherwise will be interesting to see why it works perfectly on mac, but the same code creates errors on windows
- Now that I think about it, it might have to do with the AF_FAMILY constants? Ik that there are constants that apply to different OS
- E.g. UNIX
- Either way, will check out how the code works on windows
