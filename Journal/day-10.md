### Day 10

#### Not actually day 10, just the next day in series. Couldn't be bothered to find the actual date

- Added error handling today
- So clients can leave room
- And server can handle that
- Added validation for when users enter a room
- And moved validation to front end instead of back end
- Made more sense. Quicker to get results
- And we don't need backend to know whether the inputted username is a string
- Though I want to be able to make sure usernames are unique in a room
- So will need to validate that on backend
- So will need to add some validation there when users enter a username
- Can still leave front end validation
- But they will also need to pass back end unique username validation
