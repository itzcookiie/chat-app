### 12/09/2021 - Day 7

### 10.16pm
- Tried getting the chat app to work with 2 users
- Unfortunately, whenever I tried to send a message from one user to the other
- The socket connection was closed, so it wouldn't work
- Just want to know how to do it now. Feels pretty sad
- Feels like I was really close, but I was missing a few things
- Think now is just a good time to understand what I should have done and what I needed to do
- Felt like a good run, but yeah
