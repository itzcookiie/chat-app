### Day 11

#### Not actually day 10, just the next day in series. Couldn't be bothered to find the actual date
#### Been using wrong month all this time.. it's the 9th month not 10th :facepalm

- Done some refactoring today
- E.g. changed classes to dicts because there's no point using a class just for storing variables
- Nice to have the names (namespacing) when using the variables, but no point
- Added ability for users to change room and quit (leave room) by using commands:
    - **/change_room**
    - **/quit**
- Was really happy when I got **/change_room** to work.
- Used like a machine state kinda flow to reset the CLI loop back to whatever stage we want it based on conditions
- Ready to get this hosted on Sunday now!
- Spent like 3 - 5 hours on this? Started at like 2.30pm and it's 7pm now. So that's about 4hrs 30mins

#### Main highlights
- Added /change_room and /quit command for users
- Refactored code
